<p>This note documents the reality of economic growth and Trump’s
  claim that he is responsible for “Great” economic growth prior to
  the pandemic. It uses US Bureau of Economic Analysis Data<sup><a
      href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> from 1948
  until 2019 to compare growth in Real Gross Domestic Product during
  2018 – 2019 versus history.</p>
<p>This Graph is Real GDP growth since 1948.</p>
<p>Growth was very volatile before 1983 due to poor government policy
  and shocks such as the OPEC oil embargo. After 1983 government
  policy (especially Fed policy) was better able to control the
  economy, The only negative growth years were 1991 (the DotCom bust)
  with -0.11% growth and 2008 and 2009 (the Bush Debacle) with growth
  of -0.21% and -2.54%. </p>
<p>The Table below shows average growth during different periods.</p>

<p>These data show that real economic growth was greatest during the
  60’s and 70’s. It was less during the 80’s and 90’s. It was even
  less since 2000 and none of the three presidents during that period
  achieved growth over 2.5%. </p>
<p>So, while growth during Trump’s administration prior to the
  pandemic is slightly better than Obama’s, and much better than
  Bush’s, it compares poorly to prior decades. It can hardly be called
  the greatest economy of all time. </p>
<p>Trump also boasts of the longest economic growth in history. The
  Table below lists the longest continuous growth periods in this
  history.</p>

<p>So, there are two periods of 16 years continuous growth. The
  Obama/Trump growth was only 11 years and Obama was in charge for 8
  of those years. A good argument can also be made that the first year
  of a President’s administration is basically inherited since most
  fiscal legislation was set in place prior to inauguration. So, Trump
  is only responsible for the last three years.</p>
<p>Thus, both of Trump’s claims of the longest and strongest economic
  growth in history are not true, indeed, not even close. And most of
  the credit for length is due to Obama.</p>
